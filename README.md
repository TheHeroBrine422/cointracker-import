# cointracker-import
Import scripts written in node.js to import transactions into cointracker.io

Uses a secrets.json file that contains the addresses. An example of this file is secretsEx.json

The past transactions are stored in the out.csv file after the scripts are ran. It is likely that you will need to remove transactions that you have already imported.
